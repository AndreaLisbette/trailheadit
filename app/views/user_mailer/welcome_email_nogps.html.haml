        We received #{pluralize(@trailheads.count,'Trailhead')}! They look good... but we couldn't get the GPS info. If you click the link below, you can manually update your trailhead with the correct gps coordinates (look for the edit button on the bottom of the page).

      Is there drinking water, restrooms, parking? Take a look, share with your friends and help out your local park agency by adding some more info to your trailheads.
