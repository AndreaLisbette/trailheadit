        We received #{pluralize(@trailheads.count,'Trailhead')}! Looks good… but we couldn’t get the GPS info. If your click on the link below, and then select your trailhead photo, you can update your trailhead with the correct gps coordinates (look for the edit button on the bottom of the page).

      Is there drinking water, restrooms, parking? Take a look, share with your friends and help out your local park agency by adding some more info to your trailheads.
